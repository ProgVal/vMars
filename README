What is vMars ?
===============

vMars is a MARS (Memory Array Redcode Simulator), that's to say an
implementation of the CoreWar game.
The "v" stands for visual, as it is planned to add a graphical user
interface and maybe a graphical debugger.

vMars is written in Python and is available under the MIT license.
